## HOW IT WORKS:
ITCSS is based on how sculptors work

1. Blast some rock out of a quarry (Generic)

2. Cut it down into a large block (Base)

3. Rough it into a general shape (Objects)

4. Begin adding features (Components)

5. Add fine details (Trumps)



## Jumpstart STRUCTURE:
01-Settings: Global variables, config switches

02-Tools: Default mixins and functions

03-Generic: Ground-zero styles (Normalize.css, resets, box-sizing)

04-Base: Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors)

05-Objects: Cosmetic-free design patterns

06-Components: Designed components, chunks of UI

07-Trumps: Helpers and overrides
